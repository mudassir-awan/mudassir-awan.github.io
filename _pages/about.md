I'm a research assistant at [Haptics and VR Lab](http://haptics.khu.ac.kr/) and a MS-PHD combined candidate at [Kyung Hee University](https://www.khu.ac.kr/eng/main/index.do) in  South Korea. I'm advised by [Professor Seokhee Jeon](http://haptics.khu.ac.kr/jeon/) and work on data-driven modeling and rendering of haptic properties to genrate realistic haptic feedback in VR environments. 

My research primarily focuses on modeling and rendering haptic textures using both online and offline approaches. I specialize in handling complex time series data and applying signal processing techniques. I have also utilized these skills in the context of teleoperation systems, where real-time and accurate rendering of haptic textures is crucial for remote operators.

Additionally, I explore the development of novel encountered type haptic devices such as haptic drones and wearable haptic devices in VR and AR applications.


This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
