I'm a research assistant at [Haptics and Virtual Reality Lab](http://haptics.khu.ac.kr/) and a MS-PHD combined candidate at [Kyung Hee University](https://www.khu.ac.kr/eng/main/index.do) in South Korea. I'm advised by [Professor Seokhee Jeon](http://haptics.khu.ac.kr/jeon/) and work on data-driven modeling and rendering of haptic properties to generate realistic haptic feedback in VR environments. 

My research primarily focuses on modeling and rendering of haptic textures using both online and offline approaches. I specialize in handling complex time series data and applying signal processing techniques. I have also utilized these skills in the context of teleoperation systems, where real-time and accurate rendering of haptic textures is crucial for remote operators.

Additionally, I explore the development of novel encountered type haptic devices such as haptic drones and wearable haptic devices in VR and AR applications.
