This paper introduces a framework to predict multi-dimensional
haptic attribute values that humans use to recognize the material
by using the physical tactile signals (acceleration) generated
when a textured surface is stroked. To this end, two spaces are
established: a haptic attribute space and a physical signal space.
A five-dimensional haptic attribute space is established through
human adjective rating experiments with the 25 real texture samples.
The physical space is constructed using tool-based interaction
data from the same 25 samples. A mapping is modeled between the
aforementioned spaces using a newly designed CNN-LSTM deep
learning network. Finally, a prediction algorithm is implemented
that takes acceleration data and returns coordinates in the haptic
attribute space. A quantitative evaluation was conducted to inspect
the reliability of the algorithm on unseen textures, showing that
the model outperformed other similar models.
