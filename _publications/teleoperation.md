This paper presents the first model-mediated teleoperation (MMT) framework capable of sharing surface haptic texture. It enables the collection of physical signals on the follower side, which are used to build and update a local texture simulation model on the leader side. This approach provides real-time, stable, and accurate feedback of texture. The paper includes an implemented proof-of-concept system that showcases the potential of this approach for remote texture sharing.
