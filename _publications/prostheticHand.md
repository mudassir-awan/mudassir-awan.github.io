This paper introduces a dome-shaped haptic drone with a hemispherical cage made of aluminum mesh. The cage enables controllable 3D force feedback, improving usability and user safety. Experimental measurements and mathematical formulations establish an accurate force-thrust relationship. The system's force rendering accuracy was evaluated, achieving a low error rate of less than 8.6%, ensuring perceptually accurate force feedback.
