This paper introduces a **dome-shaped HapticDrone** with a hemispherical cage made of **aluminum mesh**, designed for controllable **3D force feedback**. This advancement improves usability and user safety in haptic applications. **Experimental measurements** and **mathematical formulations** establish a reliable **force-thrust relationship**, ensuring precise haptic interaction. The **force rendering accuracy** achieved a low error rate of less than **8.6%**, making the feedback perceptually accurate.

## HapticDrone System for 3-DoF Force Feedback: Revolutionizing Kinesthetic Haptic Interfaces

The **HapticDrone system** described in this paper presents a significant improvement over previous models, particularly in its ability to offer **3-DoF force feedback**. The hemispherical cage allows for more precise and reliable haptic control, compared to traditional 1D systems. By using **advanced thrust control algorithms** and mathematical modeling, this **kinesthetic haptic interface** is able to simulate realistic haptic feedback with a high degree of accuracy.

By leveraging the **force-thrust relationship**, this system addresses the limitations of earlier haptic drones, such as inconsistent force rendering and poor user experience in complex haptic environments.

- Dome-shaped drone
- Kinesthetic haptic interface
- 3-DoF force feedback
- Haptic interface with controllable force feedback
